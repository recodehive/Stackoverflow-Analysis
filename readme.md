## Finding Insights from Stack Overflow Developer Survey

Stack Overflow is a professional community for developers, conducting a survey annually. Analyzing the dataset professionally using modern tools can enable us to answer real-world questions effectively. The dataset covers 275 questions in total.

### Project Goals:

1. Perform Analysis on the last 3 years' Stack Overflow Dataset to extract insights.
2. Analyze the impact of higher education, experience, and responsibilities on salary and gender inequalities.
3. Investigate participation rates based on ethnicity and differences in income between men and women.
4. Explore the popularity of programming languages and predict their growth based on survey responses.

### Data Source and Background

The dataset comes from the annual Stack Overflow developer survey, covering responses from developers in 180 countries. The data are available in CSV format, ranging from 40 to 150 MB, with responses from 1.5 Lakh survey participants.

### Data Format

The data is in a CSV file format with 252,199 observations and 62 variables.

### Expected Work

Data wrangling tasks include handling null values and converting data for analysis. Techniques such as ML algorithms and data visualization will be employed.
