## Finding Insights from Stack Overflow Developer Survey

### Objective:
To perform analysis on the last 3 years of Stack Overflow data to gain insights into developer trends and behaviors.

### Goals:
- Analyze the impact of higher education, experience, and responsibilities on salary and gender inequalities.
- Investigate participation rates based on ethnicity and differences in income between men and women.
- Explore the popularity of programming languages and predict their growth based on survey responses.
- Examine the impact of education, experience, and responsibilities on gender inequalities.
- Analyze the increase in popularity of a language in the current year due to developer interest in the previous year.

### Data Source and Background:
The dataset comes from the annual Stack Overflow developer survey, covering responses from developers in 180 countries. The data is available in CSV format, ranging from 40 to 150 MB, with responses from 1.5 Lakh survey participants.

### Data Format:
The data is in a CSV file format with 252,199 observations and 62 variables.

### Expected Work:
- Perform data wrangling tasks, including handling null values and converting data for analysis.
- Use techniques such as machine learning algorithms and data visualization to extract insights.
